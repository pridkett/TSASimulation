TSA Simulation

This is a simple little program that I whipped up to model a set of linked
random variables and their relations.  The core of the system, stochasticsim.py
will probably be broken off to some other library in the future.

It's licensed under the MIT X11 license.  I'm not sure about the license of
fourfn.py. At some point I'll need to write my own parser that can handle the
random variables and get a nice speed increase.

Things to Do
------------

* Eliminate the distinction between Random Variables and Calculated values in
the source code (rvs and cvs).
* Improve the parser to support variable lookup natively and hopefully get a
nice speed increase.
* Integrate with a web frontend (Webalytica)
